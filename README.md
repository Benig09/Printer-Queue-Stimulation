# Printer-Queue-Stimulation

A Java program to simulate a computer printer. The printer should store a queue of Job objects until they are printed. Each Job should consist of a title and the number of pages the job contains. The printer should also store the number of jobs it can print per minute

# What I Learned 

Implemented LinkedList and Queue data structure 

Used I/O buffers to read and write to file 

Used I/O exceptions for error handling
